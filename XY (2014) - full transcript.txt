Do you want talk about what happened tonight? What? You have nothing you want to say? No. I wanna check my emails and I want to go to bed. I gotta meet Todd really early in the morning. What was that, tonight? What? You yelling across the restaurant? I heard you say, "Dicks, pussy, licking, asshole," all in one sentence. And so did everybody else. Babe, there was nobody else sitting near us in the restaurant. What is it that you are trying to prove? I don't have anything to prove. It was a joke. Well, I'm sorry, but I don't like it when you act like that. It is embarrassing to me. You didn't have to make it really awkward, 'cause everyone felt awkward. Okay, you know what, I'm gonna go to sleep. Maybe we can talk about this sometime tomorrow, but, you know what, I... I have to sleep. Are you unhappy? Are we seriously gonna keep doing this? I wanna know. Babe, I'm happy. I don't feel like you're happy. I'm happy. Do I make you unhappy? Honestly? Do you really wanna know? Yeah. Yeah, sometimes you make me unhappy. I knew it. What? Do you wanna sleep on the couch, or should I? You're not sleeping on the couch. Then you go. I'm not sleeping on the couch either. Fine. What are you doing? You're not gonna fucking sleep on the couch! Then you go. No. Well, I'm not sleeping in bed with you. I don't want to be near you. Well, what do you want me to do? You want me to leave? Is that what you want me to do? Sure! You want me to fucking leave? If that's what you want. Go. Fine. I'll go. ♪ What are you doing? I'm looking at Facebook. You want some tea? Sure. Yeah, that'd be great. Mark. What? I don't know how to say this. I slept with Jason. You what? I slept with Jason. When? When you were out of town. Why, Sylvia? I feel alone. All the time. What am I supposed to do about it? I don't know, talk to me about it? I try to talk to you. I try to talk to you all the time. You don't want to talk to me! I tried.

Good morning. [Shower running] I love the new script. It's a beautiful world you've set up. I mean, it needs some work, but it's getting there. I have some questions. Okay, cool. Now, you have one character that's going to be played by three different actors. Yes. Why? Um... well, I mean, it's about-- it's about growth. It's about how he evolves as a person. It's about how he sees himself as a different person, in each different stage of his life. Okay. I don't think it makes sense, but you seem to think it's a good idea, so I'm confused. Yeah, I really think it can work. And the, um, cross-cutting of the stories, don't you think it would be a lot easier if it were told linearly? A lot easier to follow, you know, told in order? Well, yeah, I think it would be a lot easier to follow, yeah. Um, but, I don't think it would be very interesting. I have a secret for you. I showed it to Warner Brothers. You showed it to Warner Brothers? I just wanted to give them a taste. It's not ready. Why would you do that? You said you weren't going to do that. I know, I know, but the point is, they're excited. They're really, really excited. They love the idea. They're looking for a high concept sci-fi for a summer release. They think this could be huge. They think this could be the one. Really? They really like it? Yeah, but they have some concerns. Okay, what kind of concerns are you talking about? Big concerns? Small concerns? Well, they're concerned about three actors playing one role and the fucking cross-cutting of the stories bullshit. They also need you to end with a big chase sequence. Wow. Okay, that's some real shit. Look, if you want to do a movie for an audience of five hipsters in Williamsburg, you go right ahead. I'm not in the business of making crap, okay? You have a great idea.

No scrubbu. [Laughing] Let's go. JEN: I had a vodka soda and he had two more pilsners. And then I had a cosmo, and he had two more pilsners. Are you listening to me? Yeah. Can you look at me? Jen, I can hear you. Hi. Hi. He sounds like a winner. I really felt a connection. What happened to... Don? Doug? Don? Doug? Oh, yeah, Doug. What happened? I stopped calling him. He just wanted to do me, like, all the time. Oh, who says "do me"? He wanted to do me. To do me, like all-- like, literally all the time. And I was like, it's not even that good, so. I cut that cord. Really? 'Cause I thought you said you liked him. Okay, well, maybe he stopped calling me. [Both laughing] Oh, my god... I'm so fat! You're so ridiculous! Johnny, he's just so cute. He's just-- He's like tall, and he's like not the kind of guy that I would normally be into, but you know, maybe a change is good. Maybe I need a change. Maybe I need to just, like, do something that's, like, out of the ordinary. Maybe then it will work, you know? Oh, my god, I forgot to tell you, I met, like, the cutest, cutest guy at the coffee shop. Like, you guys-- like, you talked to him? Well, sort of. What do you mean? Well, I ordered coffee. And then? And then I asked for some sugar, and then I, like, slipped him my number on a piece of paper, the napkin. On a napkin, like you're in junior high? Yeah! No, well, he thought it was really cute, 'cause he gave me his number too. And there were all these people on the train, at 5:00 in the morning, and I was like, "Where is everybody going?" To work. To work? Yeah. I was like, "I need to be amongst the working class." Yeah, you do. That's where I want to be. You know? Like everybody was together on the train, they were heading somewhere. Revelations. Well... You should start looking for a job. It's been like three weeks, right? Yeah. I need a moment. I just need to get myself together. Okay, I guess that's the responsible thing to do. Are you okay? Are you mad at me? Did I do something wrong? Jen. No. It has nothing to do with you. I've just been having a really rough week. Do you want to talk about it? So... Mark and I are not speaking. What? He moved out. What happened? Well... we weren't communicating, and then last weekend I just realized that he's a child, and he doesn't want to grow up, so... I mean, I can't live like that. Okay, I need a lot more details than that. You can't just drop that one on me. Well, I confronted him about being loud at the restaurant last weekend. You were there. You saw him. He was being a complete asshole. Oh, it was me who made that thong joke. I thought it was funny. It wasn't funny. I thought it was. Okay, why would you even say that, Jen? What? You're just gonna take his side. You don't even know the rest of the story yet. No, I'm not. It was a joke, and I thought it was funny. Well, I thought it was embarrassing. So that's why he left? Because of a joke? You guys couldn't figure that out? No. Well, yes, but he was leaving before that. I told him about Jason. Oh, my god. You didn't. Yes, I did. I just said I did. He must've flipped. No, he didn't. That's the point, Jen. He doesn't talk. He didn't want to talk about it. How am I supposed to live with someone like that? Mark is a good guy. And he loves you. I mean, he has every right to be upset. So, what, you think that this is all just my fault? He's got no responsibility? Sylvia, you did fuck up. It's more complicated than that, Jen. Relationships are complicated. I think I know about relationships. Oh, really? 'Cause when was the last time you were in one? I haven't found a guy that's good enough. Okay, well, I don't think that's the problem, but whatever. Relationships take work. That's not really something you understand. Okay, I wouldn't understand? I'm not the one who just fucked up my relationship of six years. I may not know what it's like to be in a long-term relationship, but I do know that it requires respect. Respect? Yes. Oh, you mean like the kind of respect you get when you sleep with a guy on the first date? Don't talk to me about respect, Jen. Please, go. Are you serious? I'll take that. No, it's fine. I don't want your money, okay? Okay. Fine. I'll talk to you later. I'll call you, or something. Bye. It's Johnny, leave a message. Hey, do you mind if I smoke, please? Cool, thanks. [Knocking] [Knocking] Can I help you? Uh, yeah, is Johnny here? Who are you? Who are you? I'm his wife. Oh... Oh. Uh, can I help you? No, I just thought that I would stop by and say hi. I was in the neighbourhood. Hey. What are you doing here? Uh... How do you two know each other? We, uh, we went to college with each other. Yeah, we were in school together. Hamilton. All right, you know what? He's not my friend. Actually, we met on OKCupid, and we went out on a date last night, and I came up here to get my bag. I am so sorry. He did not tell me that he was married. Can I just have my bag? What? What do you mean, what? Go get her bag. I'm so sorry. Did you sleep with him? Yeah. I did. In my bed? I didn't know it was your bed. Do you have an STD? No! No, I am clean. I'm absolutely clean. Good, because I have a mild case of herpes, and so does Johnny. I hope you get it. Excuse me. Here.
